## Description <br/>
The application allows the user to create a "team" based on prompts that can be answered within the terminal. Each created team can consist of (1) Manager, (1+) Engineers, and (1+) Interns. Each employee description populates in an individual card within a HTML file that is created upon answering the prompts completely in the terminal. The created HTML file will be pre-formatted utilizing CSS and Bootstrap. <br/>

After installing, the product is now ready to use. To execute, type "node index.js" while the file path for this file is open in the terminal. From here, the user will be prompted to answer questions about the types of employees to add to your "Team". Once the team is created, an HTML file will be created in the dist folder and will be titled "Team.html". <br/>
